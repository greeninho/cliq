A simple android application that allows programmers to share their experiences and vision.
This application was run using wamp server with php 5.5. Tested on Motorola droid razr.
In order to effective run this application, a network connection is needed. In my case, i created a wifi connection between my computer and my phone. Therefore for the sake of testing and running, the user should

Copy the php file to the www folder location of wamp server
Open AppConfig file and change the host url to his/her own host. In my case i use my computer ip , since it is one hosting the php file.
Build and run.
